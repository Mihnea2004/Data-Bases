This project consists of creating a web application in Oracle APEX for a courier company. Before designing the application pages, I created five tables and populated them with meaningful data, thus building a complete database. The application allows users to view warehouses, routes, packages, courier deliveries, warehouse loads, add a new package, as well as generate courier statistics and report the fee per package. Each of these operations can be easily accessed through the interactive menu on the left side.

You can run the application by following the link: https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/apex/app-builder/home?fb_flow_id=226788&f4000_p1_flow=226788&session=32125113742179

As a final observation, the documentation and implementation are in Romanian, as required at the course.
